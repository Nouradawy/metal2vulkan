//! Negative / must-FALLBACK suite (refactor safety net T4).
//!
//! The crate's floor-safety argument is that unsupported inputs FALLBACK *cleanly* — a
//! `translate_sanitized_native` `Err`, never wrong-but-valid SPIR-V that a downstream gate would
//! wave through. These tests pin that behaviour for the known-unsupported classes so a refactor
//! (especially S23, panic→Result) can't silently turn a clean FALLBACK into a translate that
//! "succeeds" with garbage — or into a process abort.
//!
//! Covers known-unsupported classes: `air.intersect.*` raytracing, `llvm.agx3.*` emask
//! intrinsics, texture atomics — plus structural malformations (no definitions, truncated).
//!
//! One of them is a GAP rather than a limit: the byte-view vector store below has a lowering, it
//! just has not been written, and the reason it is pinned is that the obvious ways to write it are
//! wrong. Closing it must be a deliberate change to this test, not a silent pass.
//!
//! One class here is not an unsupported *construct* but an unmodelled *role*: an AIR stage output
//! the emitter has no case for. Those used to be skipped silently, which is the one outcome the
//! floor-safety argument does not survive — the module validates and reflects identically while the
//! value the shader computed reaches nothing. They are pinned here with their positive controls.
//!
//! One case here is deliberately POSITIVE. A rejection is only pinned from one side: a test that
//! asserts a class FALLBACKs cannot notice a change that starts rejecting inputs that used to
//! translate. The function-constant-gated pair below asserts both directions over a single
//! template, so the boundary itself is what is pinned, not just the far side of it.
//!
//! Two of these are the classes that actually turn up. Measured over a 2880-source local corpus
//! sample, 204 sources do not translate, and 191 of them are one of two shapes: a call through a
//! Metal visible function table, or an intersection whose custom intersection functions come from a
//! function buffer. Both are function pointers, which Logical SPIR-V has none of — no lowering is
//! coming, so what matters is that the rejection stays a rejection. Each is pinned below on the
//! exact diagnostic those corpus sources produce.
